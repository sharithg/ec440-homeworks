The pthread_join() function shall suspend execution of the calling thread until the target thread terminates, 
unless the target thread has already terminated. 

On return from a successful pthread_join() call with a non-NULL value_ptr argument, 
the value passed to pthread_exit() by the terminating thread shall be made available in the location referenced by value_ptr. 
When a pthread_join() returns successfully, the target thread has been terminated. 

The results of multiple simultaneous calls to pthread_join() specifying the same target thread are undefined. 
If the thread calling pthread_join() is canceled, then the target thread shall not be detached.
